# ClickGame

# Overview
The user is given 12 images and instructed to just start clicking but don't click any one image more than once. The user's score will be based on how many clicks they can get before they are wrong (click something a second time), at which time the score will be reset to zero. Every time an image is clicked (and also when the score is reset), the images will shuffle position. A top score will also be tracked, based on their best attempt.
